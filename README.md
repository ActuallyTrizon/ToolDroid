## 🚀 Advanced Features
* **Hybrid Monitoring:** Seamlessly switches between standard API and Shizuku `dumpsys` data.
* **Deep Health Metrics:** Calculates actual battery degradation using hardware charge counters.
* **System Trimming:** (Shizuku Required) Integrated commands to trim system caches and free up RAM.
* **Thermal Intelligence:** Monitor real-time milliamps and thermal thresholds.

> It defaults to standard if you have Shizuku it will unlock the system features and optimizations.
